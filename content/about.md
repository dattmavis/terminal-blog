Hello World. I'm a 33 year old codemonkey & hardware hacker living in Austin, TX.

I currently work at Avolution as a Pre-Sales Engineer and spent the ten years before that running a successful chain of cell phone repair stores in East Texas that I founded.  
  
I like to contribute to open-source projects and do some app development in what little spare time I have.

I'm super enthusiastic about tech, and while my job necessitates C# and VB.NET, my passions lie in Javascript, React, and other web frameworks.

Most days I can be found working on some coding projects, hiking around the Greenbelt, or hanging out with my wife, our GSD 'Daisy' and our little toddler.
