Hello World. I'm a 32 year old codemonkey & hardware hacker living in Austin, TX.

I currently work at 420 Science and spent the ten years before that running a successful chain of cell phone repair stores in East Texas that I founded.
I've started contributing to open-source projects and doing some app development in what little spare time I have.

I'm super enthusiastic about blockchain tech, and I've fallen in love with React and React Native. 

Most days I can be found working on some coding projects, hiking around the Greenbelt, or hanging out with my girlfriend, our GSD 'Daisy' and our little toddler.
