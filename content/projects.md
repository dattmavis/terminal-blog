**East Texas Phone Repair Chain**  
  
Built a small chain of cell phone repair stores from a living room into several brick and mortar locations that ran for ten years.  
  
- Grew the company from a single employee in 2012 into 12 employees and two  locations before selling in 2021. Directly managed stores for 7 years myself before hiring additional management.  
- Built and maintained annual average revenue of $500,000 per store, with an additional $300,000 in online parts and device sales most years.  
- Grew and maintained many B2B relationships with government partners, private  entities, and other repair stores  
- Designed and built our online platforms using JS, HTML, and CSS.  
- Maintained a customer-facing role for 6+ years, directly handling customer service and B2B contracts, including local government/schools.
